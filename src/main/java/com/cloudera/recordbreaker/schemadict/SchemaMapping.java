/*****************************************************
 * SchemaMapping describes a mapping between the labels of one schema
 * to those of another.  A mapping consists of a series of pairs of 
 * the form (schemaARef, schemaBRef).  A "ref" is a dotted attribute
 * reference.  Such a pair indicates that the attribute or structure referred 
 * to by "schemaARef" in schema A is very similar to the attr/struct referred
 * to by "schemaBRef" in schema B.
 *
 * Some attributes in each schema may not be present in the mapping.  Any attribute
 * that is present should only be present once.
